## Reflection

  - This was a task given by an employer. The task was done in 2 days.
  - This site includes a working shopping cart, a product modal, responsive design and etc.
  - This is my second React project, therefore a really good learning opportunity. More to come in the near future!
  - HTML, CSS, JS, React.
